# ASTER License Management System

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application for managing ASTER software licenses. It provides a complete license management system with a storefront for customers to purchase licenses and an admin dashboard for managing inventory, customers, and sales. The application is built with a modern React frontend and Express.js backend, using PostgreSQL for data persistence.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **UI Library**: Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, local React state for UI
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon serverless
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with Drizzle Kit for migrations
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store
- **Validation**: Zod schemas shared between frontend and backend

### Project Structure
- `client/` - React frontend application
- `server/` - Express.js backend API
- `shared/` - Shared TypeScript types and schemas
- `migrations/` - Database migration files (generated by Drizzle)

## Key Components

### Database Schema
The application uses three main entities:
- **Licenses**: Core license records with type, key, price, and status
- **Customers**: Customer information with email and name
- **Sales**: Transaction records linking customers to purchased licenses

### API Layer
RESTful API endpoints organized by resource:
- `/api/licenses` - License inventory management
- `/api/customers` - Customer data management  
- `/api/sales` - Sales transaction handling
- `/api/dashboard` - Analytics and metrics endpoints

### Frontend Pages
- **Store**: Public storefront for license purchases
- **Admin Dashboard**: Overview with key metrics and recent activity
- **Licenses**: Full license inventory management
- **Customers**: Customer relationship management
- **Sales**: Sales history and transaction details
- **Cart**: Shopping cart and checkout flow

### Authentication Strategy
Currently implements a session-based approach with plans for user authentication. The storage layer includes user management capabilities that can be extended.

## Data Flow

### License Purchase Flow
1. Customer browses available licenses in the store
2. Licenses are grouped by type with availability counts
3. Customer adds licenses to cart with quantity selection
4. Checkout process captures customer information
5. Backend creates customer record (if new) and sale records
6. Available licenses are marked as sold and become unavailable

### Admin Management Flow
1. Admin adds new licenses in bulk with license keys
2. Licenses are validated and stored with active status
3. Dashboard provides real-time metrics on inventory and sales
4. Admin can view detailed customer and sales history
5. License status can be updated (active/inactive, sold/available)

### Real-time Updates
The application uses TanStack Query for automatic cache invalidation and real-time data synchronization across all admin interfaces.

## External Dependencies

### Database
- **Neon PostgreSQL**: Serverless PostgreSQL database
- **Connection Pooling**: Built-in connection management via Neon serverless client
- **Environment Configuration**: Database URL provided via environment variables

### UI Components
- **Radix UI**: Accessible component primitives for complex UI elements
- **Lucide React**: Icon library for consistent iconography
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Class Variance Authority**: Type-safe component variant management

### Development Tools
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across the stack
- **Vite**: Fast development server with HMR
- **ESBuild**: Production bundling for the backend
- **TSX**: TypeScript execution for development

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Uses Vite dev server for frontend with proxy to backend
- Backend runs on Node.js with hot reload via TSX
- Automatic error overlay integration for development debugging
- Replit-specific development banner for external access

### Production Build
- Frontend: Vite builds to static assets in `dist/public`
- Backend: ESBuild bundles to `dist/index.js` with external packages
- Single deployment artifact with embedded static file serving
- Environment-based configuration for development vs production

### Replit Configuration
- Autoscale deployment target for production scaling
- Port 5000 mapped to external port 80
- Parallel workflow execution for development and production
- Hidden files configuration for clean workspace
